# Portfolio
This week's project was to start making our own portfolio. We had a design template to stick to, which at first sight looked fairly straight-forward but the further I got into the project the more I realized how many different elements and requirementes we had to meet. It turned out to be a complex project in the end.

This was especially so when we also introduced testing and validation. I added tabindex and aria-hidden to make the site more accessible. I focused on Chrome, Firefox and Edge. The site looks the same across these browsers. The sites although behaved differently when testing with screenreaders and keyboardfocusing.

I have focused on reaching blue level requirements. The site is built using css (lots of it), and html. If there is prize for longest code, I'm in the running. I did however manage to clean up and restructure both the html and css a bit, that made the line count somewhat smaller. 

Biggest learning this week: test throughout the coding process and make sure you include the testing time in your planning. Another learning: decide what versions, browsers, screenreaders, devices you think/know your users mainly uses and prioritize these. There will never be a perfect fit for all possible hardware and software.
